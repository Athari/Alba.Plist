Description
-----------

This is a Mac OS X Property List (Plist) serialization library written in C#. It supports both XML and binary versions of the plist format.

| plist      | C#                         |
|------------|----------------------------|
| string     | string                     |
| integer    | short, int, long           |
| real       | double                     |
| dictionary | Dictionary<string, object> |
| array      | List<object>               |
| date       | DateTime                   |
| data       | List<byte>                 |
| boolean    | bool                       |

Usage
-----

See `PlistCS/PlistCS/plistTests.cs` for examples of reading and writing all types to both XML and binary. E.g. to read a plist from disk whose root node is a dictionary:

```cs
    Dictionary<string, object> dict = (Dictionary<string, object>)Plist.readPlist("testBin.plist");
```

The plist format (binary or XML) is automatically detected so call the same readPlist method for XML

```cs
    Dictionary<string, object> dict = (Dictionary<string, object>)Plist.readPlist("testXml.plist");
```

To write a plist, e.g. dictionary

```cs
    Dictionary<string, object> dict = new Dictionary<string, object>
    {
        { "String Example", "Hello There" },
        { "Integer Example", 1234 }
    };
    Plist.writeXml(dict, "xmlTarget.plist");
```

and for a binary plist

```cs
    Dictionary<string, object> dict = new Dictionary<string, object>
    {
        { "String Example", "Hello There" },
        { "Integer Example", 1234 }
    };
    Plist.writeBinary(dict, "xmlTarget.plist");
```

Other public methods allow reading and writing from streams and byte arrays.
